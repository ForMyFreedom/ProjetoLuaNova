# New Moon Project

## What is this?
This is a Portuguese visual novel created as part of a course project about "developing a simple game for teaching [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)."

But... I got a little carried away.

## Target Audience
This game is recommended for anyone who falls into at least one of the following categories:
- Developer
- Puzzle Fan

Even though the game doesn't have a "Game Over" screen and you can progress through challenges without worrying about failure, the coding tasks are seamlessly integrated into the narrative.

## Plot
The story, set in an alternate 1900s, follows Alan Church, a Historicist Codifier in the *Moon Province*.

In a world where reality can be codified in an almost magical way, code languages have become powerful weapons during wartime.

However, as development can be challenging, translating Legacy Code from forgotten languages into the present day has proven to be an alternative of great utility, power, and... disgrace?

After a surge of newly discovered codes from a ruin in the Moon Province, a war is declarated... *The Provincial War*, fueled by fears that the Moon could become a major military power through these codes.

Or... at least, that's what everyone believes.
